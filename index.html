  <h2>What are ducks?</h2>
  <p>Did you know that a male duck is called a drake and a female duck is called a duck?</p>
  <p>Ducks are part of the watefowl family Anatidae.</p>
  <p>They are aquatic birds and are found in fresh water and sea water, although I've never seen a duck at the seaside.</p>
